                            Article V of the U.S. Constitution provides the only mechanism for amending the Constitution.
                            It describes two paths to amendment: the traditional Congressional route, and the lesser-used
                            convention route.

                            This primer focuses on the convention route, which empowers states to call for a constitutional
                            convention to propose amendments without Congressional approval. This route has never been used
                            to successfully propose an amendment, though it has come close.

                        <dd>
                            A gathering of delegates empowered to propose amendments to the Constitution.
                            Unlike a convention to draft an entirely new constitution (like the 1787 Convention),
                            an Article V convention is called for a specific purpose.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Convention Call / State Application</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A resolution passed by a state legislature requesting that Congress convene a constitutional
                            convention to consider amendments on a particular topic. When 34 states have passed similar applications,
                            Congress is obligated to call a convention.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Delegate</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A representative selected to attend and participate in the convention. How delegates are selected
                            is a major unresolved question: by state legislative appointment? Popular election? Some combination?
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Apportionment</dt>
                        <dd>
                            The distribution of delegates among states. Must it follow population (like the House of Representatives)?
                            Should every state have an equal number (like the Senate)? This is a critical design question.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Voting Rules</dt>
                        <dd>
                            The procedures by which convention delegates vote on proposed amendments. Can individual delegates vote,
                            or do states vote as units? What supermajority is required? These rules significantly affect outcomes.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Scope and Runaway Convention</dt>
                        <dd>
                            The topic(s) for which a convention is called define its scope. A "runaway convention" occurs when
                            delegates propose amendments outside their mandate. Whether and how scope can be enforced is hotly debated.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Ratification</dt>
                        <dd>
                            The process by which proposed amendments are approved by the states. Thirty-eight of fifty state legislatures
                            must vote to ratify for an amendment to become part of the Constitution. Ratification is a separate political process.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>The Threshold (34 States)</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Article V requires applications from two-thirds of state legislatures (currently 34) to trigger a convention.
                            This means that 17 states can block a convention. This threshold is sometimes called the "trigger" or "call threshold."
                        </dd>

                        <dt>The Ratification Threshold (38 States)</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Amendments—whether proposed by Congress or a convention—require ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures
                            (currently 38) to become part of the Constitution. This gives smaller states significant power in the ratification process.
                        </dd>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Historical Context</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Article V has been used successfully 27 times</strong> to amend the Constitution, but all 27 amendments
                    went through Congress first. The convention route has never been used successfully to propose an amendment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>However, the convention route has come close.</strong> In the 1960s-70s, states nearly accumulated 34 applications
                    for a convention to impose a balanced budget amendment. That effort stalled, but it demonstrated serious political momentum.
                    In recent years, interest has grown again for various amendment topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The 1787 Convention provides limited guidance.</strong> That convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation,
                    but delegates dramatically exceeded their mandate and drafted an entirely new Constitution. Whether and how to prevent
                    such an outcome in an Article V convention remains contested.
