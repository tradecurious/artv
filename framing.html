                            Article V of the U.S. Constitution provides a path for citizens and states to propose constitutional amendments
                            without waiting for Congress. As this mechanism has drawn increased scholarly and practical attention,
                            fundamental questions about how such a convention should be designed remain largely unexamined.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This conference brings together leading legal scholars, constitutional experts, state officials, and others
                            to rigorously examine the procedural and design questions that would need to be resolved before or during
                            an Article V convention. Our goal is not to advocate for or against particular constitutional changes, but to
                            create a shared knowledge base about how a convention process could work fairly, transparently, and effectively.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By addressing these questions now—before crises or imminent constitutional moments force hasty decisions—
                            we aim to contribute to constitutional health and democratic legitimacy.

                            Recent years have seen renewed interest in Article V as a potential vehicle for constitutional reform,
                            with applications from state legislatures for various topics—campaign finance reform, balanced budget amendments,
                            congressional term limits, and other issues. Simultaneously, scholarship on Article V mechanisms has expanded.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Yet despite this activity, there remains a striking gap: we lack a comprehensive, serious exploration of how
                            a convention would actually work. Legal questions about delegate selection, voting, scope, and procedure are
                            often assumed or dismissed rather than examined in depth. Political economy questions about feasibility and
                            incentives remain underexplored. Practical questions about logistics, staffing, and institutional design have
                            received little scholarly attention.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By convening now, while no single amendment proposal dominates, we create space for nonpartisan, rigorous analysis
                            of these underlying design questions. This positions the legal and policy communities to address these questions
                            thoughtfully and proactively, rather than reactively or under pressure.
