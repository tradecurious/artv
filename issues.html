                The conference is organized around six key modules addressing the most critical procedural design questions
                for an Article V convention. Each module below outlines the questions we're examining and provides pointers to
                relevant resources. Detailed papers and panel discussions will follow.

                    <p>
                        One of the most fundamental questions facing a convention is how its delegates should be chosen.
                        Article V is silent on this point, creating genuine uncertainty and multiple design options.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Key Questions:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Should delegates be appointed by state legislatures or elected by popular vote?</li>
                        <li>What qualifications, if any, should delegates have?</li>
                        <li>How many delegates should each state have?</li>
                        <li>Should delegates be professional politicians, or could they be ordinary citizens?</li>
                        <li>What mechanisms exist for removing delegates or resolving credential disputes?</li>
                        <li>How would delegate selection be coordinated across states?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The distribution of delegates across states is a critical design decision with major consequences for
                        representation and political outcomes. Should it reflect population, state sovereignty, or some hybrid model?
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Key Questions:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Should apportionment follow the House model (based on population)?</li>
                        <li>Should apportionment follow the Senate model (equal representation)?</li>
                        <li>Should there be a hybrid model balancing these approaches?</li>
                        <li>How does apportionment affect the political power of large vs. small states?</li>
                        <li>Are there constitutional constraints on apportionment choices?</li>
                        <li>How have historical conventions and other deliberative bodies handled apportionment?</li>

                    <p>
                        The rules governing how delegates vote—individually or by state block, simple majority or supermajority—
                        will dramatically affect what amendments emerge from the convention.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Key Questions:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do individual delegates vote, or do states vote as units?</li>
                        <li>What vote threshold is required to advance an amendment proposal (majority, supermajority, consensus)?</li>
                        <li>Can delegates abstain, and if so, how are abstentions treated?</li>
                        <li>How are motions, amendments, and procedural votes handled?</li>

                    <p>
                        Perhaps the most contentious issue: whether a convention can be legally or practically constrained to
                        particular topics, or whether—like the 1787 Convention—it might exceed its mandate. This question drives
                        much of the debate about Article V feasibility.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Key Questions:</h5>

                        <li>What defines the scope of a convention, and who decides?</li>
                        <li>Can states' applications legally limit the convention to particular topics?</li>

                    <p>
                        A convention cannot function without internal rules governing deliberation, procedures for seating or
                        removing delegates, and mechanisms for resolving disputes. These questions involve both legal and practical considerations.

                <h2 class="mb-4">How These Modules Interact</h2>
                <p>
                    These six modules are interconnected. Decisions made in one area affect possibilities and constraints in others.
                    For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Apportionment affects voting power:</strong> Whether delegates are apportioned by population or by state
                        fundamentally changes which states have political leverage in voting on amendments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Selection methods affect legitimacy:</strong> Whether delegates are appointed or elected influences
                        public confidence and the political pressures delegates feel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Scope limits depend on governance:</strong> Credentialing and dispute resolution procedures are key
                        mechanisms for enforcing (or challenging) scope limits on the convention.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transparency affects outcomes:</strong> More open proceedings may change delegate behavior and the
                        amendments that emerge.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This conference brings these modules together to examine both individual issues and their interaction effects.
